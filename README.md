# NSAC
Simple Anti-Cheat for FiveM

# Installation
Command: /nsac install/uninstall all/resource_name
In-order to install the anti-cheat you will have to type `nsac install all` or `nsac install resource_name` (only through server console).
After installing it restart the server.
If you would like to have your own code in these files you could edit `Config.fsCode` in the config file, for now it will detect if `_G` was set to nil as an example.

### Detections
